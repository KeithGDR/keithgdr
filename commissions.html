	<ul>
	<li>Pay upfront or half and half for all projects regardless of size and scope.</li>
	<li>I only accept money usually through Paypal, Venmo or Cashapp. You can request to make Steam purchases though if there's any available.</li>
	<li>Bugs caused by me have 2 weeks to be fixed for free after finding them, otherwise they&#39;re paid to be fixed.</li>
	<li>Bugs not caused by me and not fixable within 5 minutes are paid for.</li>
	<li>New features and enhancements to existing features is new work to be paid, even if the amount is smaller than $10.</li>
	<li>$10-$50 fee depending on the size of the project if It&#39;s private or not. Code that&#39;s private will not be package and resold.</li>
	<li>All code automatically comes with source code by default.</li>
	<li>Be sure the code/work you want doesn&#39;t exist already on the internet.</li>
	<li>Be sure to ask the AlliedModders forum if it can&#39;t be found or for other friendly coders who may do the work for free.</li>
	<li>If the code exists and you want changes to it, the same prices above apply with a $5 fee applied.</li>
	<li>If there&#39;s work previously that was never finished for any reason, be sure to bring it up because it could mean credit towards new work.</li>
	<li>Refunds are allowed if the project isn&#39;t done a week within the estimated time frame.</li>
	</ul>
